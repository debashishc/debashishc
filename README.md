- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multi-modal machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning GPU programming, focusing on CUDA and Triton for efficient machine learning implementations.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m open to help with model distillation, quantization and efficient LLM training.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about natural language processing, image generation, quantization or anything related to machine learning deployment.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <details coming soon>
- âš¡ Opinion: Iâ€™m both fascinated and cautious about superintelligence. I believe itâ€™s crucial to focus on building and deploying safe AI agents while ensuring AI democratization.
