- 🔭 I’m currently working on multi-modal machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- 🌱 I’m learning programming Hetergenous Parallel Systems, focusing on CUDA and Triton for efficient machine learning implementations.
- 🤔 I’m open to help with model distillation, quantization and efficient training and deployment of large ML models.

- ## 👨‍💻 Research Interests

- Developing and optimizing **multi-modal model architectures** with scalable data input processing to enhance performance in distributed environments.
- Streamlining model training, fine-tuning, and inference processes for seamless integration with **cloud** and **edge computing** interfaces.
- Implementing **hardware- and IO-aware ML model compression techniques** to optimize inference efficiency and reduce computational overhead.
