- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multi-modal machine learning and dimensionality reduction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GPU programming, CUDA and Triton towards efficient machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Efficient Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning (once I understand it), Adversarial Machine Learning and Explainable AI.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with (you guessed it, maybe) model distillation and LLM training.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about natural language processing, image generation and anything machine learning related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <details coming>
- âš¡ Opinion: I am both fascinated and concerned about superintelligence, and believe we should understand and deploy safe AI agents and democratize it.
